### Day 1: December 26. Wednesday
Begining of the long chanlenge.

Starting with a simple url shortener app.
It can be found here [Tiny URL](https://github.com/danielrubango/tiny-url).
It's a simple app and I will enjoy if it inspire one of you.
Working on this litle project helps me be more productive reading documentation precisely and writing code quickly.
I will continue update this project and let it be more insterresting for new comers.

See you on the next step.
